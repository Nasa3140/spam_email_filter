# Spam Email Filter

This is a Python program that demonstrates a spam filter using the Naive Bayes algorithm. It classifies emails as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam) based on their content.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn library

You can install the required library using the following command:


    ** pip install -U scikit-learn **
## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the spam filter is available on Kaggle. You can download it from the following link:

- [Spam Mails Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/venky73/spam-mails-dataset?resource=download)

Please ensure that you have downloaded the dataset and placed it in the same directory as the Python script.

## Usage

1. Update the `csv_file_path` variable in the code to the path of the downloaded CSV file.

2. Run the script using the following command:

## python spam_email.py


3. The program will display the accuracy of the spam filter on the test dataset.

4. Enter a new email when prompted. The program will predict whether the email is spam or ham.

## Credits

This program is developed using the scikit-learn library and the spam dataset from Kaggle.



## Spam Filter

The spam filter program uses the Naive Bayes algorithm to classify emails as spam or ham (non-spam) based on their content.

## Face Detection in Video with Number of Speaker

The face detection program utilizes OpenCV for detecting faces in a video and performs speaker diarization to estimate the number of speakers.




## Credits

These programs are developed using the scikit-learn library for the spam filter, and OpenCV library for face detection and speaker diarization.
