# Spam Filter & Face Detection in Video with Number of Speaker

This repository contains two Python program folders: a spam filter and a face detection system in a video with speaker diarization. The programs demonstrate the use of machine learning techniques for text classification and computer vision tasks.

 
## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- scikit-learn library
- OpenCV library

You can install the required libraries using the following commands:

    ** pip install -U scikit-learn **
    ** pip install opencv-python **

## Spam Filter

The spam filter program uses the Naive Bayes algorithm to classify emails as spam or ham (non-spam) based on their content.

## Face Detection in Video with Number of Speaker

The face detection program utilizes OpenCV for detecting faces in a video and performs speaker diarization to estimate the number of speakers.




## Credits

These programs are developed using the scikit-learn library for the spam filter, and OpenCV library for face detection and speaker diarization.
