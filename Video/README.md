## Face Detection in Video with Number of Speaker

The face detection program utilizes OpenCV for detecting faces in a video and performs speaker diarization to estimate the number of speakers.

### Usage

1. Update the `video_path` variable in the code to the path of the video file.

2. Run the script using the following command:


## python face_detect.py

  The program will open a window displaying the video with bounding boxes around detected faces.

## python speaker.py

  It will also calculate the number of speakers in the video and display the result.

## Credits

These programs are developed using OpenCV library for face detection and speaker diarization.
